=======
Changes between ontology file EDM version 5.2.4 \(edm, was once EDM-v524-120820\)
and ontology file EDM version 5.2.3 \(EDM-v523-120123\)
=======
1. edm:isShownAt made a sub-property of edm:hasView
2. added edm:begin and edm:end and their mappings to CRM
3. added owl:Class declarations added for compatibility with some OWL-DL reasoners \(feedback from Pedro Szekely, ISI\)
4. added "of" at the end of the label for edm:isNextInSequence
5. added vocabulary metadata to follow Linked Open Vocabularies \(http://lov.okfn.org/\) and ADMS \(https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/adms/release/100\) guidelines
6. removed a domain axiom on edm:hasMet
7. added edm:collectionName and edm:europeanaProxy
8. removed version number from file name
9. generalisation of Country, DataProvider and Provider
10. updated CRM namespace and CRM class and property identifiers
11. added FRBRoo mappings

=======
Remaining TODOs for ontology file EDM version 5.2.4
=======
- finish and check FRBRoo mappings according to the recommendations of the EDM-FRBRoo task force. Also include implicit mappings and mappings for elements outside the EDM namespace?
- try to capture formal cardinality constraints resulting from "Obligation and Occurrence" documentation, which should be attached to non-EDM constructs \(esp. ore:Aggregation\)
- continue adding documentation values \(skos:scopeNote, skos:example, etc, according to 1.\), starting from edm:InformationResource. Add all Europeana examples and rationale notes for non-EDM constructs
- use specific EDM-doc properties for "rationale" and "obligation and occurrence". Use skos:definition for "Europeana definition", skos:example for "Example", skos:note for "Europeana note"
